An important piece of information before you start the exceptions section:

Previously, exceptions were only part of the PCAP exam (Associate level) and were completely absent from the PCEP exam (Entry level). However, a 2022 change to the Entry-level exam syllabus introduced exceptions basics to the syllabus.

In theory, the syllabuses of PCEP and PCAP should be different: PCAP should test new, more advanced topics that PCEP doesn't. However, in case of exceptions, it seems that both exams require the knowledge of exceptions basics. I also got a written confirmation from the Python Institute that this is the case: even though PCEP now verifies your exception basics knowledge, the same kinds of questions can reappear in the more advanced PCAP exam.

That's why the first four videos in this section are marked (PCEP&PCAP). These four videos are almost identical with my PCEP course. If you feel like you already know everything from PCEP, you can simply skip these videos and move on to the videos about more advanced exceptions concepts.
