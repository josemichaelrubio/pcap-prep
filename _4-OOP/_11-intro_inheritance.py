* Inheritance: Intro
---------------------
Inheritance = when one object or class is based on another object or class
Super classes contain subclasses.
`pass` = a placeholder since Python throws an error for empty blocks
`issubclass(subclass, superclass)` = check if a subclass is a subclass for a superclass
	â€¢ Subclasses of a subclass is also subclasses of the superclass
a class is a subclass of itself
